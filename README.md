# counter_bloc

A new Flutter project.

1.useState: Manages and updates local state within a HookWidget, triggering UI rebuilds when the state changes.
2.useEffect: Executes side effects, like fetching data or setting up subscriptions, when the widget builds or dependencies change.
3.useMemoized: Caches the result of expensive computations, recomputing only when dependencies change, and is ideal when youâ€™re not directly triggering the UI or state updates.
4.useFuture: Simplifies handling asynchronous operations, managing loading, success, and error states in the UI.
